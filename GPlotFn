Ggplot visualisations
Install ggplot by typing in the following code:
install.packages("ggplot2")
Once installed, you can activate the library using the following code:
library(ggplot2)
Now try this code (same as above only in ggplot):
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(am), mpg))
p + geom_boxplot()
Now add a jitter to show density:
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(am), mpg))
p + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width = 0.2)
Add a third dimension â€“ engine size (vs):
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(am), mpg))
p + geom_boxplot(aes(colour = factor(vs)))
